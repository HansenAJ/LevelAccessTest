This application was created for the Level Access Technical Assesment to simulate an accesible log in page.

Three users profiles are already built in.
    user:"level", pass: 'Access123'
    user:"LaurenH", pass: 'LaurenPass'
    user:"AlexH", pass: 'AlexPass'


A new user can be created, logged out, and logged back in. However this application was built without a database for simplicity, 
all created users will be lost when the session is closed.
